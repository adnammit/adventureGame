The Oubliette:You wake up in a cold, damp cell. What is going on?:Key:100:Fortunately your jailor is really incompetent. There is a key laying on the cell floor.:2:1<[1] The window has thick bars on it, but there is a door-You stumble out of the cell and into a poorly lit hallway.-9<[9] Let's just stay here. It's actually kind of nice.-Congrats, genius. You have died of thirst.-
The Mezzanine:It is drafty and you hear cries of terror echoing off the walls:Purple Rain:750:You found a mint copy of Prince's Purple Rain. Sweet! You've been looking for one of these forever!:2:2<[2] You could walk down a dark stairway towards the screaming. That sounds like a pretty fun time.-The smell of decaying carcasses permeates the air as you descend the stairs. You remain confident that this was a good decision.-3<[3] You could take the stairs and hope there's something better up there.-You open the door at the top of the stairs and enter a room with a sole occupant: an evil witch.-
The Dungeon:There is a Dragon with a Million Silvery Scales. He looks really hungry despite having just devoured dozens of brave men.:Mirror:750:You found a mirror! :2:5<[5] You suspect that the dragon may be rather vain. You try and distract him with the mirror.-It works! The dragon is completely enamored by his reflection and forgets about eating you. You stumble out into the sunlight and find yourself in the casemate, surrounded by weaponry.-9<[9] You decide to engage the dragon in fisticuffs. After all, you are no coward!-You are brave, but also an idiot. The dragon, looking rather bored, devours you in a single bite.-
The Lair of the Evil Witch:It reeks like toads in here.:Broom:500:The witch insists on giving you her old broom. It's missing a few straws, but the witch really wants you to have it. I think she's sweet on you. Maybe she's not so evil after all.:3:8<[8] Your visit with the witch has you feeling so buoyant, you're ready to fly! You jump on the broom and fly out the window.-After taking a few laps around the castle exterior, you see an open window with a beautiful maiden inside and decide to pay her a visit.-4<[4] You're too thirsty for flying. The witch has recommended an excellent well nearby, highly rated by Zagats.-You take a relatively safe and grounded trip down the hall towards the well-6<[6] Well water sounds great, but the scent of hops and malt wafts down the hallway. You follow your nose...-Delight of delights, you find yourself in the buttery!-
The Well:The well is deep and dark. You drop a small pebble down it and it seems to fall forever. You can tell that it holds many secrets.:The Courage to be Rich:50:What... Could it be? Someone has left a copy of "The Courage to be Rich" by Suze Orman on the side of the well! Score!:2:0<[0] Make a wish at the well.-Your wish must have been to play this game again, cos it's so freaking awesome!-7<[7] You are distracted by gentle candlelight and angelic singing. You walk towards it to discover its source.-You find yourself in the castle chapel.-
The Casemate:You look around, astounded by the shear numbers of swords, muskets and cannons that this castle doesn't have.:Rusty Sword:100:All the good swords were taken.:3:8<[8] Being in the midst of all these weapons is making you feel amorous. You dash off in search of a damsel in distress.-There's no distress to be had, but after barging into several rooms you do manage to find a damsel.-9<[9] You find some old gun powder and decide to blow your way out of this infernal castle.-You manage to blow yourself up instead. Huzzah.-7<[7] All this talk of bloodshed and women is making you feel pious. You wander off in search of spiritual enlightenment.-You find a door labeled "Jesus wuz here." This sounds promising.-
The Buttery:You have found the buttery! At last!:Jonathan Goldsmith, The Most Interesting Man in the World:800:Jonathan Goldsmith is sitting at the bar. What better company to drink ale in?:1:9<[9] Sit and have a pint?-Jonathan Goldsmith crowns you the King of the Universe! You enjoy a fine pint of ale and reflect on your adventure.- 
The Chapel:You walk into the middle of a service. To your surprise, Father Steve Martin is delivering a rousing sermon on "the healing power of the love of a beautiful woman." You shed several tears.:Thermos:250:You find a thermos! Not an ordinary thermos, but the best thermos you can buy, with vinyl and stripes and a cup built right in!:2:6<[6] Steve Martin says "Come my child, walk with me." You are so very moved by Steve Martin's words that you oblige.-You find yourself in the buttery. You always knew Steve Martin was a stand up guy.-9<[9] You are not a fan of Steve Martin and go your own way.-You are accosted and carried away by a group of demon worshippers who sacrifice you to Baal, High Commander of the Armies of Hell.-
The Bower:Your sudden entrance to the lady's chambers has caused her not an insignificant degree of distress.:Kathy Bates:500:Could it really be? Kathy Bates? You find her presence in the bower to be strange, yet calming.:2:2<[2] You realize that the damsel is distraught because you have not yet taken her in your big, strong arms. You do so presently.-Apparently you are not a mind reader. The damsel is greatly angered by your indiscretion and has you thrown into the Dragon's dungeon.-9<[9] To assuage her distress, you whip out your mint copy of "Purple Rain"-The damsel (who, turns out, is the princess) falls in love. You live happily ever after or some $%#* like that.-
